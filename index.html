                <h2>Re-Cycle benefits both you and the enviroment!</h2>
                <p>Re-Cycle has a mission. We want to become the leading method for tourists (or curious locals!) to experience the beauty and flexibility of cities and their back-alleys in an enviromentally concious way! This is also a perfect way to exercise both the body and the mind!</p>
